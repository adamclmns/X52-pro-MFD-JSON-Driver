# X52-pro-MFD-JSON-Driver
Drive the Logitech/Saitech X52 pro MFD by writing to a JSON file.

This software will allow you to write to the MFD on the throttle base by updating the contents of a JSON file from a separate application. This means that you can use any programming language of your choice to determine what information to display, and won't have to deal with C++.

## Important Information
Grab the latest release version of this app. Unzip it to a location of your choice. Creating a separate folder and putting this app in it would be a good idea and also make for easy deletion if needed.

If the console window is clicked it will pause itself because it is waiting for input so, for it to continue functioning, hit the Esc key. To quit hit the 'X' button on the window or using 'Ctrl + C' in the console window.

Run the program with the path of the JSON file as command line input.
